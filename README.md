# üßëüèº‚Äçüíª SwiftUI Workshop (Completed)

**You are currently viewing the completed project, change to `main` before cloning**

This project is to be used for workshops teaching how to build a SwiftUI app. The starter code already has models, a way to load data and decode it, as well as the skeleton files for the final project. Below you will find step by step instructions. If you get stuck and want to look at the final project you can take a peek at the `completed` branch.

*Part of this workshop requires Xcode 12*

## List View
The first step is to complete the `ListView`. Here we want to display a List of all stores within a NavigationView. You'll be using the `DataManager` as source of truth, and navigate to the `DetailView` when a user taps on a cell within the List. For guidance what data to display you can have a look at the screenshots below.

## Data Loading
Next we will implement data loading from a server. I already have the `DataLoader` prepared for you, but your task is to hook this up to the `DataManager`. In the `ListView` you will then add a `onAppear` handler that will tell the `DataManager` to load the data.  

## Detail View
Finally we will implement the `DetailView`. You'll be using a single `AppleStore` property within, for the preview you can use the `testStore` provided by the `DataManager`. Within this view we'll want to display a `Map` showing the location, store hours, phone number, and a `Link` to the website. For more detailed design references see the screenshots below.

## Additional Tasks
Additionally I encourage you to explore how you can leverage `CLLocationManager` to ask for the user's current location. This will then allow you to sort the stores by distance to the user, while also displaying the distance in either km or miles.  
Furthermore I encourage you to explore `CLGeocoder` as a way to convert the latitude and lonitude into a human readable address format. This API works asynchronously, so similar to the data loading you'll have to use `@Published` to update your view on completion.
